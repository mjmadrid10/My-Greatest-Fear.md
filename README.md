Death:
The thought of dying scares me as I don't know when it will happen. It could happen anytime whether I'm causious or uncausious. Before I sleep or go to bed, the thoughtof not waking up scares me.

Dark:
After watching a horror movie, I get scared and tend to be afraid what is in the dark. There could be ghosts, mystical creature or even monstrs that would be seen on television.
